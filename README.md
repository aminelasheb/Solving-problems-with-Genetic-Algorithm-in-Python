# Solving-problems-with-Genetic-Algorithm-in-Python
A genetic algorithm to solve the problem a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 30 with integer variables. It generates random chromosomes, selects parents according to the objective function, crosses the chromosomes to generate descendants and mutates the descendants to explore new solutions. The best chromosome obtained after several generations is returned.
